## Welcome to the Gender Equality Community github organisation!

We're the Kaluza GEC, and we're happy to see you here 👋

This organisation is where we store our open source tooling, including various anonymous reporting tools and chatbots.

### Contributing

We welcome all contributions 🥹

However... we still haven't setup out [CLA (contributor licence agreement)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement), or even if we need one, so we miiiiight ask you to hold off on Pull Requests for now.

<!--

🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
